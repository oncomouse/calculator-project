# Calculator

This project implements a calculator using React, redux-toolkit, and styled-components. mathjs is used for calculation and a number of complex, calculator behaviors are supported (repeatedly pressing enter will repeat the last operation; pressing one number, an operation, and equals will calculate the operation on that number twice; etc.)
